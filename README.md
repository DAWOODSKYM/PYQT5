# PYQT5
The program will realize a simple workflow for extracting features from a shapefile on disk based on selection by attribute and selection by location. Please download the attached zip file Attachment.zip. Extract the data to a new folder and check out the two shapefiles that are contained in the zip file, countries.shp and OSMpoints.shp, in ArcGIS.
This is a python script that can run outside of a text editor using its own GUI.
The script uses the licenced python library by ARCGIS Arcpy and to use it one must have a an ArcGis license.
Incase of lack of the licence, try to implement other open source python libraries
Several scripts are included showing various implementations of the GUI interface but concept remains the same.
Included are copies of the GUIs.
